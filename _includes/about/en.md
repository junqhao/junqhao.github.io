Hi, there. It's Junqing Hao. <br><br>
I graduated from Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT) with an Master's Degree in Engineering in 2019.<br><br>
Now I'm an iOS developer and currently working at [Netease](http://netease.com). My duty job is developing several apps of [Youdao](https://shared.youdao.com/www/about.html). Besides, I focus on doing research of  new technologies, making efficiency & debugging tools, optimizing CICD process, etc. I once worked at [iQIYI](https://www.iqiyi.com), dedicated on the development of base functions.<br><br> 
In addition to coding, I'm also cultivating my product sense and capabilities of designing. I pay daily attention to the user experience and operating modes of various mobile products. I'd like to use Sketch or Photoshop to design prototypes when I got some inspirations.<br><br>
In life, I am a senior music enthusiast and collector of classic old songs. Welcome to follow my Netease Cloud Music account. I also like to Shoot some pool or workout for a while, I mainly focus on health-preserving activities now.<br><br>
Since I came into contact with the first stray cat in 2021, I have participated in the rescue of more than 10 stray cats. I occasionally share my daily life with them in Xiaohongshu. Time with these cats always gives me extra peace of mind.<br><br>
