Hi,there. It's Junqing Hao(Alex). <br>
I graduated from Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT) with an engineering master's degree in 2019.<br>
I got my bachelor degree of Software Engineering from Harbin Engineering University (HEU) in 2016.<br>
I'm an iOS developer and currently working at [Netease](http://netease.com). I'm focusing on new tech research, efficiency tools, SDK optimization and other issues. In the past, I worked at [iQIYI](https://www.iqiyi.com), dedicated on the development of basic user experience. What's more, I had participated in the translation of the book "Recommender Systems " by Charu C. Aggarwal.<br>
I believe 『it's never too late to get started』, let's strive for a better life!<br>
